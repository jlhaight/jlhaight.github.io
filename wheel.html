                 This wheel was designed completley from scratch with two goals in mind: make it functional, make it cool. In terms of
                 functionality, this design improves assembly, modularity, waterproofing, ergonomics, and strength. The biggest complaint with
                 the previous design was that assembling it was a nightmare - it took our electronics team about 4 hours. For this wheel, everything 
                 was designed to mount directly to the custom PCB housed in the center. Not only did this make assembly significantly easier, 
                 but the whole system was now modular, allowing for easy access and repair if water got into the enclosure. Waterproofing was 
                 another major improvement, with no leaks over 40 hours of testing and competetion. To ensure that the wheel could be dissasembled easily,
                 we cut a custom gasket out of EPDM on our waterjet, and sealed the top housing to the carbon panel and bottom housing to the frame 
                 with silicone. For ergonomics, the handles were designed using surface modeling in Solidworks, and only uses a little over 60 features.
                 A big reason why the handles had such a drastic change in shape is because of our suspension - bumbsteer was greatly reduced, and 
                 steering lock to lock decreased from 120 degrees to 90. The biggest challenge, however, was making a button layout that both satisfied
                 our drivers, and was physically possible.

                  Part level FEA was done in Solidworks on the frame for the steering wheel. The image on the right shows the loadcase for maximum 
                  driver torque - about 80 ft lbs from our testing. Another simulation was done on frame rigidity for a 50 lb load acting parallel to the 
                  rotation axis. For both of these sims, the frame hit our minimum required FoS of 1.5.

                  This is a picture with the wheel partially assembled with prototype handles. Here, you can clearly see that the frame was cut on our waterjet,
                  and that our handles are 3D printed. As mentioned above, the gasket was also cut on our waterjet, and the back housing, 
                  like the handles, was ultimatley 3D printed out of Carbon PETG. The carbon panel was outsourced as our team does not have the means to cut carbon safely.
