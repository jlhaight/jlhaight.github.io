                 This design is a direct iteration to the previous year, which saw no failures during testing or competetion. However, they were
                 overbuilt (FoS of 7.2) and a little difficult to machine. As such, I set out to reduce weight by at least 10%, and machine time 
                 by 15%. I initally thought that because our car does not have a reverse gear, I would be able to optimize the topology for torque
                 applied continuously in one direction. However, it soon became apparent that a symmetrical design would be better for transients 
                 seen during operation, and so decided to mimic the previous year. To decrease weight, I reduced both wall and arm thickness, and 
                 removed all non-essential filets to lower machine time. From here, it was a matter of tweaking the design with our head CNC machinist.

                    What you are seeing on the right is a structural analysis done in Ansys. The loads for this simulation were taken directly
                    from our wheel force transducer testing, and account for the maximum loads and moments in all three coordinate directions. 
                    For the boundary conditions, the hub is cylindrically constrained along the trilobe surface (which is where torque is applied
                    from the rear half-shaft), and has a frictionless surface support along the back face and bolted connections. From here, I setup
                    a remote force and remote moment, setting the bolt holes as the load bearing surfaces. I also setup different coordinate systems
                    corresponding to different wheel rotations to make sure that the hubs could take any expected load in any orientation.

                  Currently in progress, the CAM profile for these hubs was done in Fusion 360, and machining will be done with two fixtures on 
                  a 3 axis Haas CNC mill. The roughing passes will be done with a half inch end mill and finishing passes for contours done with 
                  a half inch ball nose.
